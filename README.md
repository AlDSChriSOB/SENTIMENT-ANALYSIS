# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed on Twitter regarding the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset specifically curated for this purpose, we aim to understand public sentiments towards various candidates participating in the election.

Workflow
Data Collection
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and contains tweets related to the Nigerian Presidential Election of 2023. The dataset can be accessed here.

Data Preprocessing
Prior to analysis, extensive preprocessing was performed on the collected tweets. This involved removing irrelevant information such as URLs, hashtags, mentions, and special characters. Additionally, stop words were eliminated, and stemming or lemmatization techniques were applied to reduce feature dimensions. Furthermore, candidate mentions were extracted to tag each tweet appropriately.

Labeling
Each preprocessed tweet was labeled with one of three sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral, based on the overall sentiment conveyed in the text.

Feature Extraction
Relevant features were extracted from the cleaned and labeled tweets. Two common methods, bag-of-words and TF-IDF, were considered to represent the tweets as numerical vectors.

Training and Testing
The labeled data was split into training and testing sets. A Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the training set, and model performance was evaluated on the testing set using standard evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction
The trained models were then utilized to predict the sentiment of new tweets related to the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election.

Visualization
Results of the sentiment analysis were visualized using various charts, graphs, or word clouds to provide intuitive insights into public sentiments.

Analysis
A comprehensive analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes of both models. Additionally, the correlation between the sentiment analysis and the actual election outcome was explored to assess the predictive power of the sentiment analysis.

Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to gain valuable insights into public sentiments surrounding the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election, contributing to a better understanding of voter perceptions and preferences.
